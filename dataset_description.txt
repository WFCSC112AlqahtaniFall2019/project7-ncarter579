For my Data set I chose to look at all NBA player's stats who were in the league for the past years. Specificly, I looked at every player's points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, and net rating because I viewed these four as the most important. I chose to look at this data because i'm a fan of the NBA and have always enjoyed talking about players stats with my friends. Theirfor I though it would be fun to learn how to manipulate and sort this data.
